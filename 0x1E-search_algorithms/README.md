More Info

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
 . 0(1)
 . 0(n)
 . 0(n!)
 . n^m-> o(nm)
 . n square -> 0(n^2)
 . sqrtn -> 0(sqrt(n))
 . log(n) -> 0(log(n))
 . n*log(n) -> 0(nlog(n)
 . ...


Tasks

 0. Linear search
 
 Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
	. Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
	. https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/295#:~:text=linear_search(int%20*array%2C%20size_t%20size%2C%20int%20value)%3B-,Where%20array%20is%20a%20pointer%20to%20the%20first%20element%20of%20the%20ar	. Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
	. size is the number of elements in array
	. And value is the value to search for
	. Your function must return the first index where value is located
	. If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
	. Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 2, binary_search(array, size, 2));

 1. Binary search

 Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
	. Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
	. Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
	. size is the number of elements in array
	. And value is the value to search for
	. Your function must return the index where value is located
	. You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
	. You can assume that value wonâ€™t appear more than once in arra
	. If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
	. You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray) (See example)

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 2, binary_search(array, size, 2));
